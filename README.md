# Jesse Lemieux's Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio build with react, by Jesse Lemieux. My motivation was to create a SPA portfolio website using react. I built this project so
so I could have a professional showcase of my coding skills as well as a landing place for future potential employers to get to know a little about me.
Some problems I solved during development were:
- Creating a sound SPA envirnment using react
- Using technologies and frameworks froms other libraries(using any and all tools at my disposal)

Some things I learned during development were:
- Using Gatsby and React together to build a SPA website

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
