# Jesse Lemieux's Portfolio

## Description

A professional portfolio build with react, by Jesse Lemieux. My motivation was to create a SPA portfolio website using react. I built this project so
so I could have a professional showcase of my coding skills as well as a landing place for future potential employers to get to know a little about me.
Some problems I solved during development were:
- Creating a sound SPA envirnment using react
- Using technologies and frameworks froms other libraries(using any and all tools at my disposal)

Some things I learned during development were:
- Using Gatsby and React together to build a SPA website
